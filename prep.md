# Before You Cut
Before you start using the laser, we need to get it configured and ready so nothing goes wrong! You definetly do not want to skip this step to avoid having to buy the school a new laser($10,000).

## Focusing the laser
Before doing anything else, we need to focus the laser. To do this, on the control screen, find the down arrow(**__NEVER__** use the up arrow unless you are absolutely sure you know what you are doing. This can break the laser) and lower the bed a few inches. Place your material on the bed in the desired location. For best results, put the top left corner of your material in the top left corner of the build area. Using the other 4 arrows, move the focusing probe(gold pen looking thing) to the center of your material. Once it is centered, click the "Auto Focus" button in between the up and down arrows to have the laser automatically focus itself! 

## Setting Refrence Markers
On the bottom left hand side of the screen you will see the button for setting refrence markers. Click it to open up the marker menu and begin setting your markers. To do this, simply move the laser head to each corner of your material, and hit the "set marker" button. The center of the laser probe will show a red dot on your material to show where it is. If you cannot see it, try turning the light attached to the gantry off by flipping the switch located on the right outside wall of the laser, above the ethernet cable. After you have set your refrence markers, you will be able to view them in retina engrave to help line up your project.

## Connecting to the Laser
To do this, get any laptop(not a chromebook), and plug the USB end of the yellow ethernet cable in. After a few seconds, type the laser's IP adress into the URL search bar of chrome. The IP can be found in the bottom right corner of the display at the top of the few listed numbers(if youre lazy it's ###.##.##.##). This will direct you to Retina Engrave 3.0!
