# Turning the Laser On
Turning the laser on is quite simple, and only has 3 steps!

## Step 1
Make sure the laser workspace is clear! Take anything off of the door, make sure the interior gantry and workspace is empty of debris and any old material. 

## Step 2
Look for the power strip on the the wall. This should be right behind the laser. Flip the switch to the on position. This turns on the exhaust/filtration system, the laser coolant pump and gives the laser itself power. When you flick the switch, the laser will beep for a few seconds to alert you to it being powered on!

## Step 3
After the alarm stops, turn the key on the front of the laser to the on position. After a few seconds, the screen should light up. It will take up to a minute for the system to boot up & it is normal to not see any display on the screen until then. Once the system boots up, the laser will display a warning. If this is your first time using the laser, be sure to read it! If not, go ahead and click the continue button. About 30 seconds after you click the continue button, the laser will load you into the control screen! You are now done turning the laser on and can proceed to the next step!
