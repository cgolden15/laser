# Introduction
Welcome to this Laser Cutting & Engraving tutorial, specifically created for Pennsbury High School's Full Spectrum Laser. I will guide you through every step of using the laser, from turning it on to turning it off. By following this tutorial, you will gain a thorough understanding of the laser cutting and engraving process and be able to create your own high-quality results. Let's get started!

This tutorial will assume you have a basic understanding of a any 2d or 3d modeling software such as Retina Engrave, Fusion360, Onshape, etc. Retina Engrave is the included softare which we will use to control the laser & for basic cutting or engraving. Fusion360 and Onshape are free for students within Pennsbury and can be used to create more complex designs that cannot be done through retina engave. If you do not already have access to this, ask your teacher! No extra software is needed!
